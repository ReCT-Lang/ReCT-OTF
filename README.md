# Rect OTF

## Notes (temporary) 
- PHP backend (simple, not fancy framework stuff)
- We'll use PHP's execute function to execute ReCT code and show the output in the browser
- We can use a virtual environment to allow code execution without code ruining the server
- We could use a "manager" to run the environments (creating them, deleting them, etc)
- The "manager" would create a new environoment for code execution
